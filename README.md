# Temprature Display using LM35 sensor and LCD I2C

This project aims to display room temprature using LM35 sensor and an LCD I2C. I've uploaded the code and the circuit.

Requirements:
1. Arduino Uno
2. LM35 temprature snesor
3. LCD I2C
4. Bread baord
5. Wires

NOTE: In the uploaded circuit image, the sensor is not the same as I've mentioned since TINKERCAD doesn't provide LM35 sensor. The pins are the same btw.
